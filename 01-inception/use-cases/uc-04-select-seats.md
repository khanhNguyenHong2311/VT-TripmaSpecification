# UC-04: Select Seats

> Reference basis: the Tripma application source and its implemented or visibly planned functionality. This specification may complete that functionality for the target system.

## Functional Use-Case Specification

### Use Case ID

UC-04

### Use Case Name

Select Seats

### Description

As a visitor, I want to choose seats for my Tripma itinerary so that I can continue preparing my booking.

### Actor(s)

Visitor

### Priority

High

### Trigger

The visitor enters the Tripma seat-selection experience from the passenger-information step.

### Pre-Condition(s)

PRE-1: A prepared passenger-information context is available.
PRE-2: The related flight-selection context can be accessed.

### Post-Condition(s)

POST-1: When the selection is accepted, Tripma makes a completed seat-selection context available to the payment experience.
POST-2: Tripma preserves the preceding booking-workflow contexts.
POST-3: When the selection cannot be accepted, Tripma keeps the visitor in the seat-selection experience and reports the outcome.

### Basic Flow

1. Tripma opens the seat-selection experience for the current booking workflow.
2. Tripma requests seat information through API-SEATS-LIST.
3. The seat service evaluates the request according to the Business Rules of this use case.
4. The seat service returns the corresponding seat information.
5. Tripma presents the seat-selection controls.
6. The visitor chooses a seat.
7. Tripma updates the current selection according to the Business Rules.
8. Tripma presents any remaining seat-selection activity.
9. The visitor completes the remaining activity, when applicable.
10. Tripma evaluates the current seat-selection state according to the Business Rules.
11. The visitor chooses to continue.
12. Tripma completes the required continuation processing according to the Business Rules.
13. Tripma creates the completed seat-selection context.
14. Tripma opens the payment experience.

### Alternative Flow

AF-1: Change a seat choice
6a. The visitor chooses a different seat for the current selection position.
6b. Tripma updates the selection according to the Business Rules.
6c. The Basic Flow resumes at step 8.

AF-2: Confirm a prompted seat change
7a. Tripma presents a confirmation requested by the Business Rules.
7b. The visitor confirms the change.
7c. Tripma applies the pending selection.
7d. The Basic Flow resumes at step 8.

AF-3: Cancel a prompted seat change
7e. The visitor cancels the pending change.
7f. Tripma preserves the preceding selection.
7g. The Basic Flow resumes at step 8.

AF-4: Continue to another selection position
8a. The visitor moves to another position offered by the seat-selection experience.
8b. Tripma presents its current seat information.
8c. The Basic Flow resumes at step 6.

AF-5: Save and close the in-progress selection
10a. The visitor chooses Save and Close.
10b. Tripma processes the current state according to the Business Rules.
10c. The use case ends without entering the payment experience.

AF-6: Resume an in-progress selection
1a. Tripma finds a previously saved seat selection.
1b. Tripma evaluates and restores it according to the Business Rules.
1c. The Basic Flow resumes at step 2.

### Exception Flow

EF-1: No seat options returned
4a. If the service returns no seat options, Tripma presents an informational empty state.
4b. The visitor remains in the seat-selection experience.

EF-2: Current selection cannot be accepted
12a. If continuation processing rejects part of the current selection, Tripma identifies the affected position.
12b. Tripma keeps the visitor in the seat-selection experience and returns to step 5.

EF-3: Seat request cannot be completed
2a. If Tripma cannot complete an API-SEATS-LIST request, it presents a recoverable error state.
2b. Tripma does not open the payment experience.

EF-4: Selection is not ready to continue
10d. If the current state does not satisfy the Business Rules, Tripma identifies the incomplete selection activity.
10e. The continuation action remains unavailable.

EF-5: In-progress selection cannot be saved or restored
10f. If Tripma cannot process the in-progress selection, it preserves the current usable state and presents a recoverable outcome.

Technical constraints:
- Saved choices must use protected, time-limited storage and must be discarded when their passenger or flight-selection context changes.


BR-SEAT-017: Seat selection has no reservation side effects
Selecting or preparing seats shall not create, update, or delete Booking,
PassengerInfo, SeatAssignment, Flight, or Seat records.
