# UC-10: View Flight Deals

## Functional Use-Case Specification

### Use Case ID

UC-10

### Use Case Name

View Flight Deals

### Description

As a visitor, I want to view Tripma flight deals so that I can discover featured destinations.

### Actor(s)

Visitor

### Priority

Low

### Trigger

The visitor opens a Tripma experience that provides flight deals.

### Pre-Condition(s)

PRE-1: The Tripma flight-deal experience is available.
PRE-2: Tripma can attempt to retrieve the deal collection.

### Post-Condition(s)

POST-1: When retrieval succeeds, Tripma presents the returned flight-deal collection.
POST-2: When retrieval cannot be completed, Tripma reports the outcome without changing deal data.

### Basic Flow

1. The visitor opens a Tripma experience containing flight deals.
2. Tripma requests the deal collection through API-FLIGHT-DEALS-LIST.
3. The flight-deal service evaluates the request according to the Business Rules.
4. API-FLIGHT-DEALS-LIST returns the deal collection.
5. Tripma presents the returned flight-deal summaries.
6. The visitor reviews the available flight deals.

### Alternative Flow

AF-1: View the complete deal collection
6a. The visitor requests the complete flight-deal collection from the current experience.
6b. Tripma presents the complete collection returned by API-FLIGHT-DEALS-LIST.

AF-2: No flight deals are available
4a. API-FLIGHT-DEALS-LIST returns an empty collection.
4b. Tripma presents the empty flight-deal experience.

### Exception Flow

EF-1: Request cannot be completed
2a. If Tripma cannot complete the request because of a technical failure, it presents a retryable error state.

### Related UI

Flight Deals experience available from the Tripma home and flight-discovery pages

### Related API IDs

API-FLIGHT-DEALS-LIST

### Notes

Scope clarification: UC-10 retrieves and presents flight deals only. Flight search remains assigned to UC-01, and selecting a deal does not define additional navigation or search behavior in this use case.
